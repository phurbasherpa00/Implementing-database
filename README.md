# Implementing-database


The purpose of the Project is to create or implement a New Database Management system for the  
University at Buffalo.


In this Document there are business reports which helps the
hospital system find different important data and information about the hospital. We will also create
stored procedure which is needed to make business decision and business reports by executing the
business reports that are created.
